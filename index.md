## Welcome to my Website!

I am an astronomy graduate student at Cornell University. Learn more about my interests [here](/about.md). To learn more about my background, check out my [CV](/CV.pdf). 

This website has been made using Markdown. I use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ishan-mishra/sample-website-2/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for my website in Markdown files.

Whenever I commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in the site, from the content in my Markdown files.

### What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

GitHub Pages site uses the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme I have selected in my [repository settings](https://github.com/ishan-mishra/sample-website-2.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
